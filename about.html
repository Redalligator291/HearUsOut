      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>We are two high schoolers from Sunset High School passionate about protecting the next generation 
      of listeners by providing lessons and workshops on hearing and hearing habits. As well as protecting
      the future we understand that many people are currently living with conditions related to hearing loss. 
      At HearUsOut we plan on sponsoring and funding as many pairs of hearing aids as 
      we can for the underprivileged and low income community.</p>
